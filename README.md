Lightweight Text-based editor.<br/>
No dependencies needed just run make.<br/>
This editor is based in the KILO editor as described in:https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html<br/> 
I followed the tutorial and added replace capabilities to the search function described there.<br/>
Im planning to mantain this version of the code and keep adding some functionalities.
